# Project-Automated-Threat-detection

This is an smart system which uses Yolo V3 algorithm to detect 3 classes of potentially dangerous animals i.e. Tigers, Elephants and Bears . Once detection is done, actuator hardware gets turned on via Arduino UNO R3 :

1. The Indication lights get turned on, showing the visual alert
2. Buzz alarm starts to ring
3. GSM Module (SIM 900A) is used which sends an immediate notification to particualar mobile phone signalling emergency
